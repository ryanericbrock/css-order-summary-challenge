### What I learned

This project helped with my current understanding of how to style websites with basic CSS without the use of Bootstrap or any similar frameworks. One of the biggest things I learned from doing this project is how to make sure that an image does not overflow outside of its div container. Another thing that I learned through this project is how table data widths work with CSS.

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to focus on trying to neaten up my style sheet so that I do not have as many classes to juggle. Although my css was able to accomplish the job, I would like to optimize my approach in the future.

Most of what I have learned this far is from Dr. Angela Yu's Udemy course titled "The Complete 2022 Web Developer Bootcamp". It has been vital to my understanding of web development and I highly recommend checking it out for any other beginners!
